//! Places and opens a project's SQLite event store under a caller-chosen
//! file name: angzarr-store-sqlite's [`SqliteStore`] at a path the caller
//! names (a project's directory, from the shared `project-dir` crate, with
//! the opener's file name: [`Opener::file_in`]).
//!
//! The file name and the directory are the caller's arguments; this crate
//! names neither. It holds nothing open: the caller keeps the store it is
//! lent, as it likes.
//!
//! - The path is the caller's, on the [`Fs`] the opener is given: its
//!   directory is made through the seam, and SQLite opens the file where the
//!   seam says it is on disk ([`Fs::real_path`]), so a re-rooted filesystem
//!   holds the database (and its write-ahead log) too.
//! - [`Opener::open_for_write`] opens it to write, creating its directory and
//!   the file; [`Opener::open_existing`] opens it read-only and never
//!   creates it, finding no store where there is no file.
//! - Both migrate a store older than the build (angzarr-store-sqlite's every
//!   open does), backing the store up beside itself first, and refusing,
//!   untouched, a store newer than the build or one a migration failed or
//!   changed in. This crate writes no SQL and takes no backup of its own.
//! - A store written before the embedded store existed (an earlier event
//!   store's, its ledger only its first migration) is refused by both, keyed
//!   [`OpenError::PredatesEmbedded`] with its `path` and the `backup` to move
//!   it to (`<path>.pre-embedded`), and left exactly as it was: never
//!   migrated in place. Its ledger is read before either open
//!   ([`SqliteStore::ledger_at`]), which migrates nothing.
//! - A store is its owner's alone: its directory 0700 (each one the open
//!   makes, and the store's own made so if it was not) and the file, with
//!   the `-wal` and `-shm` SQLite keeps beside it, 0600, set on every open,
//!   to write or to read, whatever the umask, so an existing store open to
//!   others is made its owner's on its next open. SQLite makes the log and
//!   shared memory with the file's own mode. The modes are set through the
//!   seam, which sets none on Windows: there the profile's ACL holds the
//!   store. One that cannot be set fails the open
//!   ([`OpenError::Restrict`]), the store closed.
//! - [`Opener::check`] checks a database whole
//!   ([`SqliteStore::integrity_check`]), opened afresh and read-only. Damage
//!   is a key and its args, never English; a file too damaged to open is
//!   damage too. No database is no damage ([`Checked::Absent`]).
//! - Errors are [`OpenError`]; [`OpenError::into_store_error`] carries one in
//!   angzarr-ports' `StoreError` for a caller whose port speaks that.
